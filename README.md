# wfirst_imsim

This branch (meds) stores a snapshot of the simulation that successfully produces MEDS output.

In addition to pretty standard stuff (and galsim), it needs this (https://github.com/adrn/mpipool) for parallelization across nodes. This is based on something by Joe Zuntz for the des-mpp pipeline / cosmosis.
