# wfirst_imsim

The simulation code is changing rapidly as development occurs. This branch represents a static version of the code used for the paper "A Synthetic WFIRST High-Latitude Imaging Survey: Simulation Suite and the Impact of Wavefront Errors on Weak Gravitational Lensing". 

The documentation for this code is likely out of date, and support is not intended.

Nonstandard dependencies are represented in setup.py.

See wiki for information on how to run and documentation.
