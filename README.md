In order for the shape measurement modules to work, you must have ngmix and ngmixer and the necessary supporting software installed.

In addition to pretty standard stuff (and galsim), it needs this (https://github.com/adrn/mpipool) for parallelization across nodes. This is based on something by Joe Zuntz for the des-mpp pipeline / cosmosis.
